Rocket go phoosh

I am experimenting with particle systems. I thought this would be cool project to implement it on.

# WARNING
Spagetti Code

# updates:
  - Added realistic flame effect
  - Added delta time for smoother movement
  - Added somewhat of a slow mo effect which you can trigger by pressing 'S' key(Hold it down)
